# Code

This code was written for my second MSc project, under the supervision of Pr. Timothy Ebbels and Cecilia Wieder.

Converting single omics data into pathway scores facilitates the data integration process for downstream analyses, such as differential network analysis of different disease or treatment groups, and provides a more holistic view of the biological processes underlying disease.

The scripts in this repository analyse the proteomic and metabolomic datasets from a recent paper by Su et al. studying COVID using various omics datasets, which can be accessed at:
Multi-Omics Resolves a Sharp Disease-State Shift between Mild and Moderate COVID-19 (Su et al., 2020)
DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.037

The method for conversion to pathway scores was conducted using the sspa package, developed by Wieder et al.:
Single sample pathway analysis in metabolomics: performance evaluation and application (Wieder et al., 2022)
